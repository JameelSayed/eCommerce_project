# Visual template for a responsive E-commerce website.
Please note that this project is basically a ready to use visual structure for an e-commerce website that is responsive for all tablet and mobile devices.

Kindly note the following:
* The shopping cart in this project is a visual example only. There will be a seperate project solely focusing on the shopping cart later on.
* The Mario outfit product opens into it's own page as an example of how product pages would look in a fully functioning e-commerce website.
* The rating system is also visual only.

I hope you enjoy going through this project as much as I had making it, in case of any questions please do not hesitate to ask.
